Sudo permissions are required to run the program.

This is a project designed to prevent horizontal privilege escalation by monitoring
su usage and locking accounts that fail password checks multiple times.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK. Due to the nature of this program, it is possible to lock
accounts extremely easily. It is recommended to manually set the script parameters to your
liking, and making sure to have an administrator account ready to unban accounts.
